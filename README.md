geoutil
======

A library of Geospatial function Utilities for NodeJS

introduction
------------

This is a really early pre relase of this library. The idea is to create a easy way to define, 
interact, and manipulate geospatial data. 

installation
------------

    clone the repo, run npm install.

Functions
---

Currently, this library only defines a couple of geometries. Points and bounds. It contains code to 
if points are contained by bounds.


Todo
----

A lot.

- define the rest of the common geometries: lines, polygons, multipolygons. 
- add functions to calculate distance, , and contains for all geometries.
- manipulates for geometies: poly simplify, create poly that contains list of points.
